# Notifications / Alerts

- Live Regions 
	- Accessiblity Talks <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5YAaLLBKhQ&feature=youtu.be>
	- Live Region Codepen <https://codepen.io/iankonlineada/pen/eYJwQBY>

## Aria Roles

1. alert
2. status

### Poor support

1. aria-atomic : what is read?
2. aria-relevant : when it is read
3. aria-busy : maybe don't read this? Wait until something else is done. Dependent on screen reader / user tech.
