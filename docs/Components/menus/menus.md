# Menus

Menus come in many shapes and sizes, and are essential parts of any website. They are used for navigation and to provide functionality for critical parts of web pages and applications. Since menus reflect the underlying structure of websites, they are critical parts of web pages and applications and require particular attention during design and development to be friendly and usable to all users. Making a menu accessible isn't just about the underlying code -- it's also about organization.
